## 💡 Real-Life Applications of Machine Learning

### 🔍 Web Search Engines
- Platforms like **Google**, **Bing**, and **Baidu** use ML to **rank web pages** when you search for anything — e.g., *“How to make a sushi roll”*.

### 📷 Photo Apps (Instagram/Snapchat)
- Automatically **recognize and tag friends** in your photos using facial recognition powered by ML.

### 🎥 Movie & Content Recommendations
- After watching a movie (e.g., *Star Wars*), streaming services use ML to suggest **similar titles you might enjoy**.

### 🗣️ Voice Recognition
- ML powers:
  - Voice-to-text (e.g., texting through speech)
  - Voice commands:  
    - **“Hey Siri, play a song by Rihanna”**  
    - **“OK Google, show me Indian restaurants near me”**

### 📧 Spam Detection
- Emails like *“🎉 You’ve won a million dollars!”* are filtered out as **spam** using ML algorithms.
