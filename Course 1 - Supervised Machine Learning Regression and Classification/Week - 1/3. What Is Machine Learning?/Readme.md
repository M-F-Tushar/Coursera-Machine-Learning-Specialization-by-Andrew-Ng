# 📘 Lecture 3: What Is Machine Learning?

## 📖 Definition of Machine Learning

One of the earliest and most influential definitions of machine learning was provided by **Arthur Samuel**:

> **"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."**  
> — Arthur Samuel

## 🎮 The Checkers Story

Arthur Samuel created a **checkers-playing program** in the 1950s, even though **he wasn't a great checkers player** himself.

- He programmed the computer to **play tens of thousands of games against itself**.
- By analyzing which positions led to **wins** or **losses**, the program:
  - Learned **what made a good or bad position**
  - Gradually became **better than Samuel himself**

> 🧠 This example shows how a computer can **learn from experience** — a core idea of machine learning.

## 📝 Interactive Quiz Insight

You were asked:
> *What would happen if the computer had played far fewer games?*

✅ Correct Answer: It would perform worse.

💡 The more opportunities you give a **learning algorithm to practice**, the **better it performs** — just like humans.

## 🧠 Two Main Types of Machine Learning

In this course, you’ll learn the **most widely-used ML algorithms** categorized into:

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**

These will be covered in-depth in the next videos.

> 🥇 **Supervised learning** is the most commonly used and fastest advancing ML type in real-world applications.

## 📦 Specialization Structure

This course is part of a **3-course specialization**:

1. 📘 Course 1: Supervised Learning
2. 📗 Course 2: Advanced Supervised Learning
3. 📙 Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommender Systems & Reinforcement Learning

## 🛠️ More Than Just Algorithms

Learning ML algorithms is like getting access to **state-of-the-art tools** (e.g., hammers, drills).

> But having tools isn’t enough — you need to know **how to use them effectively.**

This course provides:

- The **tools (algorithms)** of machine learning
- The **skills and intuition** to apply them effectively

---

## 🚧 Real-World Lessons Matter

Even skilled ML teams at top companies can spend **months with little progress** due to:
- Misapplied algorithms
- Poor development strategies

This course focuses on:

- **Best practices**
- **Common pitfalls to avoid**
- **Real-world experience** in developing **practical ML systems**

> You’ll learn to think like an expert ML engineer — designing systems that work **efficiently** and **effectively**.

---

## 🧠 Your Outcome

By the end of this course:

- You’ll understand how to **build serious, production-ready ML systems**
- You’ll be among the rare individuals who can both:
  - Select the right ML tools
  - Apply them **strategically** for real-world impact
