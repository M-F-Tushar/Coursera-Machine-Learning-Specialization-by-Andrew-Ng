## Supervised Learning

### Definition and Core Concept
**Supervised Learning**: Algorithms that learn **X to Y** or **input to output** mappings.

**Key Characteristic**: You provide the learning algorithm with examples that include the **right answers** (correct labels Y for given inputs X).

### How Supervised Learning Works
1. **Training Phase**: Show the algorithm correct pairs of (input X, desired output Y)
2. **Learning Process**: Algorithm learns patterns from these examples
3. **Prediction Phase**: Algorithm takes new input X (without output label) and predicts Y

### Real-World Applications

- **Output (Y)**: Text transcript
- **Application**: Voice-to-text systems

#### **Machine Translation**
- **Input (X)**: English text
- **Output (Y)**: Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, etc.
- **Application**: Google Translate, other translation services

#### **Online Advertising (Most Lucrative)**
- **Input (X)**: Information about an ad + information about you
- **Output (Y)**: Probability you will click on the ad
- **Impact**: Every click generates revenue for ad platforms
- **Economic Significance**: Drives major revenue for large online platforms

#### **Self-Driving Cars**

- **Input (X)**: Picture of manufactured product (e.g., cell phone)
- **Output (Y)**: Defect detection (scratch, dent, or OK)
- **Application**: Visual inspection systems
- **Impact**: Reduces defects, improves product quality

### Types of Supervised Learning

#### **1. Regression**
**Definition**: Predicting numbers from infinitely many possible values.

**Housing Price Example**:
- **Dataset**: Houses with sizes (square feet) and prices
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot with size on X-axis, price on Y-axis
- **Problem**: Friend has 750 sq ft house - what price?

**Possible Solutions**:
- **Straight Line Fit**: Might predict ~$150,000
- **Curved Line Fit**: Might predict ~$200,000
- **Algorithm's Job**: Systematically choose most appropriate fit

**Key Point**: Regression predicts any number from continuous range (150,000 or 183,000 or any value in between).

#### **2. Classification**  
**Definition**: Predicting categories from a small, finite set of possible outputs.

**Breast Cancer Detection Example**:
- **Input (X)**: Patient medical records, tumor characteristics
- **Output (Y)**: Benign (0) or Malignant (1)
- **Importance**: Early detection can save lives

**Visualization Options**:
1. **2D Plot**: Size on X-axis, classification (0 or 1) on Y-axis
2. **1D Line**: Using different symbols (circles for benign, crosses for malignant)

**Multiple Categories**:
- Can have more than 2 categories
- Example: Benign, Type 1 Cancer, Type 2 Cancer (3 categories)
- Terms "classes" and "categories" are interchangeable

**Key Differences from Regression**:
- **Categories vs Numbers**: Can be non-numeric (cat vs dog) or numeric (0, 1, 2)
- **Finite Set**: Limited, discrete options (not 0.5 or 1.7)
- **Decision Boundaries**: Algorithm finds boundaries between categories

### Multiple Input Features

**Single Feature Example**: Just tumor size
**Multiple Features Example**: Tumor size + patient age

**Enhanced Prediction**:
- **Improved Accuracy**: More inputs often lead to better predictions
- **Decision Boundary**: Algorithm finds boundary separating classes
- **Real-World Complexity**: Breast cancer detection uses many additional inputs:
  - Thickness of tumor clump
  - Uniformity of cell size
  - Uniformity of cell shape
  - And many others

### Summary of Supervised Learning
- **Core Concept**: Maps input X to output Y using labeled training examples
- **Two Main Types**: 
  - **Regression**: Predicts numbers from infinite possibilities
  - **Classification**: Predicts categories from finite set
- **Applications**: Extremely wide-ranging across all industries
- **Economic Impact**: Creates 99% of machine learning's economic value today

## Unsupervised Learning

### Definition and Core Concept
**Unsupervised Learning**: Given data that **isn't associated with output labels Y** - algorithm must find structure, patterns, or something interesting in the data **on its own**.

### Key Difference from Supervised Learning
- **Supervised**: Has input X and correct answers Y
- **Unsupervised**: Has only input X, no "right answers" provided
- **Goal**: Find hidden patterns without being told what to look for

### Types of Unsupervised Learning

#### **1. Clustering**
**Definition**: Automatically groups similar data points together.

##### **Google News Example**
**Daily Process**:
- Scans hundreds of thousands of news articles
- Groups related stories automatically
- **Example**: "Giant panda gives birth to rare twin cubs at Japan's oldest zoo"

**Pattern Recognition**:
- **Common Words**: "panda" appears in all related articles
- **Related Terms**: "twin", "zoo" also appear across articles
- **Automatic Discovery**: Algorithm finds these patterns without human instruction

**Why Unsupervised?**:
- Topics change daily
- Too many articles for human processing
- Algorithm discovers groupings independently

##### **DNA/Genetic Analysis Example**
**Data Structure**:
- **Micro Array Data**: Like tiny spreadsheets
- **Columns**: Each represents one person's DNA
- **Rows**: Each represents a specific gene
- **Colors**: Show gene expression levels (red, green, gray, etc.)

**Applications**:
- **Gene Expression**: Measures how active certain genes are
- **Individual Differences**: Shows variations between people
- **Pattern Discovery**: Groups people by genetic similarities

**Example Categories Found**:
- **Type 1**: People with certain genetic patterns
- **Type 2**: Different genetic expression patterns  
- **Type 3**: Yet another distinct group

**Key Point**: Algorithm discovers these types without being told what to look for.

##### **Market Segmentation Example**
**Business Application**: Understanding customer bases better

**DeepLearning.AI Community Research**:
- Analyzed why people take courses, subscribe to newsletters, attend events

## 6. Linear Regression Model

### Overview
**Linear Regression**: Fitting a straight line to your data - probably the most widely used learning algorithm in the world today.

**Importance**: Concepts learned here apply to other ML models throughout the specialization.

### Problem Setup: House Price Prediction

#### **Dataset**: Portland House Prices
- **Input Feature (X)**: House size in square feet
- **Output Target (Y)**: Price in thousands of dollars
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot with size on horizontal axis, price on vertical axis
- **Data Points**: Each cross represents one house sale

#### **Real Estate Scenario**
**Situation**: You're a real estate agent helping a client sell her 1,250 sq ft house
**Question**: "How much do you think I can get for this house?"
**Approach**: Use linear regression to estimate price

### Linear Regression Process

#### **Model Fitting**
1. **Draw Line**: Fit straight line through data points
2. **Make Prediction**: Find where 1,250 sq ft intersects the line
3. **Read Price**: Trace to vertical axis to get estimated price (~$220,000)

#### **Why This Works**
**Supervised Learning Characteristics**:
- **Training Data**: Houses with both size AND known selling prices
- **Right Answers**: Actual prices provide correct labels
- **Model Learning**: Algorithm learns from input-output pairs
- **New Predictions**: Model can estimate prices for unseen houses

### Regression vs Classification

#### **Regression Model Characteristics**
- **Output**: Predicts numbers (prices in dollars)
- **Range**: Any numerical value (220,000 or 1.5 or -33.2)
- **Examples**: Price prediction, temperature forecasting, stock values

#### **Classification Model Characteristics** 
- **Output**: Predicts categories or discrete classes
- **Examples**: Cat vs dog, medical diagnosis, spam detection
- **Key Difference**: Limited set of possible outputs

### Data Representation

#### **Visual Representation**
- **Graph**: Scatter plot showing relationship
- **Axes**: Size (horizontal) vs Price (vertical)

#### **Tabular Representation**
**Data Table Structure**:
- **Input Column**: House sizes
- **Output Column**: House prices
- **Correspondence**: Each row = one data point on graph

**Example**:
- Row 1: 2,104 sq ft house sold for $400,000
- Appears as data point at coordinates (2104, 400)
- Total dataset: 47 houses (47 rows, 47 points)

### Machine Learning Notation

#### **Standard Terminology**
- **Training Set**: Dataset used to train the model
- **Training Example**: One row of data (one house)
- **Input Variable**: X (also called "feature" or "input feature")
- **Output Variable**: Y (also called "target variable")

#### **Mathematical Notation**
**Dataset Size**:
- **m**: Total number of training examples (m = 47 in this case)

**Individual Examples**:
- **(x, y)**: Generic training example
- **(x⁽¹⁾, y⁽¹⁾)**: First training example
  - x⁽¹⁾ = 2,104 (size of first house)
  - y⁽¹⁾ = 400 (price of first house)
- **(x⁽ⁱ⁾, y⁽ⁱ⁾)**: i-th training example

**Important Note**: Superscript ⁽ⁱ⁾ is NOT exponentiation - it's just an index referring to the i-th example.

### Supervised Learning Process

#### **Training Phase**
**Input**: Training set with both input features (X) and output targets (Y)
**Process**: Feed this data to learning algorithm
**Output**: Function f (the trained model)

#### **Model Function**
**Mathematical Representation**: f(x) = wx + b
- **f**: The model function
- **w**: Weight/slope parameter  
- **b**: Bias/y-intercept parameter
- **x**: Input feature (house size)

**Alternative Notation**: 
- Sometimes written as f_w,b(x) to show dependence on parameters
- Can be simplified to f(x) when parameters are understood

#### **Prediction Phase**
**Input**: New house size (x = 1,250 sq ft)
**Process**: Apply function f to the input
**Output**: Predicted price (ŷ = ~$220,000)

**Notation**:
- **ŷ** (y-hat): Predicted value
- **y**: Actual true value (when known)
- **Key Difference**: ŷ is estimate, y is actual truth

### Model Representation

#### **Linear Function**: f(x) = wx + b
**Why Linear?**: Starting with straight lines because they're:
- Relatively simple to understand
- Easy to work with
- Foundation for more complex models
- Still very useful in practice

**Future Extensions**: Later you'll learn non-linear functions (curves, parabolas) for more complex relationships.

### Model Names
- **Linear Regression**: General name for this approach
- **Linear Regression with One Variable**: More specific (one input feature)
- **Univariate Linear Regression**: Fancy term meaning "one variable"
  - "Uni" = one (Latin)
  - "Variate" = variable

**Future Extension**: Multiple variables (house size + bedrooms + age + etc.)

### Next Steps
**Cost Function**: Most important concept coming next - used in:
- Linear regression
- Training advanced AI models
- Universal machine learning principle

The cost function will tell us how well our model is performing and guide us toward better parameter choices.

---

## 7. Cost Function

### Purpose and Importance
**Goal**: Measure how well the model performs so we can improve it.
**Universal Concept**: Used in linear regression and advanced AI models worldwide.

### Model Parameters Review

#### **Linear Function**: f_w,b(x) = wx + b
**Parameters**: w and b
- **Alternative Names**: coefficients, weights
- **Role**: Variables you adjust during training to improve the model
- **Impact**: Different w and b values create different lines

### Parameter Effects on the Model

#### **Example 1**: w = 0, b = 1.5
- **Function**: f(x) = 0·x + 1.5 = 1.5
- **Result**: Horizontal line at y = 1.5
- **Prediction**: Always predicts $1,500 regardless of house size
- **y-intercept**: b = 1.5 (where line crosses vertical axis)

#### **Example 2**: w = 0.5, b = 0  
- **Function**: f(x) = 0.5·x + 0 = 0.5x
- **Result**: Line through origin with slope 0.5
- **Examples**: 
  - x = 0 → f(x) = 0
  - x = 2 → f(x) = 1
- **Slope**: w = 0.5 (rise over run)

#### **Example 3**: w = 0.5, b = 1
- **Function**: f(x) = 0.5·x + 1
- **Result**: Line with slope 0.5, y-intercept 1
- **Examples**:
  - x = 0 → f(x) = 1
  - x = 2 → f(x) = 2
- **Components**: Slope = w, y-intercept = b

### Choosing Good Parameters

#### **Objective**: Find w and b values so the line fits the training data well
**Visual Goal**: Line should pass through or close to most training examples
**Challenge**: How do we measure "fits well" mathematically?

### Cost Function Construction

#### **Prediction vs Reality**
For each training example i:
- **Actual Value**: y⁽ⁱ⁾ (true price)
- **Predicted Value**: ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ = f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b
- **Error**: ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾ (how far off our prediction is)

#### **Squared Error Approach**
**Step 1**: Calculate error for each example
- Error = ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾

**Step 2**: Square the error
- Squared error = (ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
- **Why square?**: Prevents positive/negative errors from canceling out

**Step 3**: Sum over all training examples
- Total squared error = Σ(i=1 to m) (ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²

**Step 4**: Average the squared errors
- Average = (1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) (ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
- **Why average?**: Prevents cost from growing just because we have more data

**Step 5**: Conventional adjustment
- Final cost = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) (ŷ⁽ⁱ⁾ - y⁽ⁱ⁾)²
- **Why divide by 2?**: Makes later calculus calculations neater

### Final Cost Function Formula

#### **Mathematical Expression**:
**J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²**

Where:
- **J(w,b)**: Cost function (depends on parameters w and b)
- **m**: Number of training examples
- **f(x⁽ⁱ⁾)**: Model prediction for example i
- **y⁽ⁱ⁾**: Actual value for example i

#### **Alternative Form**:
**J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²**

### Cost Function Names
- **Squared Error Cost Function**: Most common name
- **Mean Squared Error**: Another common name
- **Why "Squared Error"**: Takes the square of error terms

### Usage in Machine Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Most commonly used cost function
- **Other Regression Problems**: Widely applicable
- **Good Results**: Works well for many applications
- **Alternative Cost Functions**: Exist for different applications, but squared error is standard

### Objective
**Goal**: Find values of w and b that minimize J(w,b)
**Next Step**: Understand what this minimization means intuitively

**Coming Up**: Detailed examples showing how cost function behaves with different parameter values and why minimizing it leads to good models.

### Optional Calculus Derivation

#### **Derivative of Cost Function with respect to w**:

Starting with: J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²

Since f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b:

J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²

**Partial derivative with respect to w**:
∂J/∂w = (1/2m) × Σ(i=1 to m) 2[wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾

**Simplifying** (2's cancel):
∂J/∂w = (1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾

#### **Derivative of Cost Function with respect to b**:
∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]

**Note**: This is why we included the 1/2 factor - it makes the derivatives cleaner by canceling the 2 from the chain rule.

## 8. Gradient Descent

### Introduction and Importance
**Gradient Descent**: Algorithm to find values of w and b that minimize cost function J(w,b).
**Universal Importance**: Used throughout machine learning, including:
- Linear regression
- Advanced neural networks  
- Deep learning models
**Foundation**: One of the most important building blocks in ML

### General Gradient Descent Algorithm

#### **Objective**: Minimize any function J(w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ, b)
**Not Limited to Linear Regression**: Works for any cost function, any number of parameters
**Examples**:
- Linear regression: J(w, b)  
- Neural networks: J(w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ, b)

#### **Algorithm Steps**:
1. **Initialize**: Start with initial guesses for all parameters
2. **Iterate**: Keep changing parameters to reduce cost
3. **Converge**: Continue until J settles at or near minimum

**Common Initialization**: Set all parameters to 0 (works well for linear regression)

### Intuitive Understanding: The Hill-Walking Analogy

#### **Visualization Setup**
**3D Surface**: Imagine cost function as a hilly landscape
- **Axes**: w and b (horizontal), J(w,b) (height)
- **Hills**: High cost areas
- **Valleys**: Low cost areas (minima)
- **Goal**: Get from hilltop to bottom of valley efficiently

#### **The Walking Process**
**Step 1**: You're standing at some point on the hill
**Step 2**: Look around 360 degrees  
**Step 3**: Determine direction of steepest descent (fastest way downhill)
**Step 4**: Take a small step in that direction
**Step 5**: Repeat until you reach the bottom

**Mathematical Equivalent**: Direction of steepest descent = negative gradient direction

#### **Key Property: Multiple Local Minima**
**Starting Point Matters**: Different starting points can lead to different valleys
- **Example 1**: Start here → End up in valley A  
- **Example 2**: Start nearby → End up in valley B
- **Local Minimum**: Bottom of each valley (algorithm gets "trapped")
- **Global Minimum**: Lowest point overall (may not be reachable from all starting points)

### Mathematical Formulation

#### **Update Rules**
**Parameter w**: w = w - α × (∂J/∂w)
**Parameter b**: b = b - α × (∂J/∂b)

**Notation Explanation**:
- **=**: Assignment operator (not mathematical equality)
  - `a = c` means "store value c in variable a"
  - `a = a + 1` means "increment a by 1"
- **α (Alpha)**: Learning rate
- **∂J/∂w**: Derivative (partial derivative) of cost function

#### **Learning Rate (α)**
**Definition**: Controls size of steps taken downhill
**Typical Values**: Small positive number, often between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.01)

**Effect on Algorithm**:
- **Large α**: Aggressive steps (might overshoot)
- **Small α**: Conservative baby steps (slow but safe)

#### **Derivative Term**
**Purpose**: Tells you the direction to step
**Combined Effect**: α × derivative = both direction and step size

### Implementation Details

#### **Simultaneous Update Requirement**
**Correct Implementation**:
```
temp_w = w - α × (∂J/∂w)
temp_b = b - α × (∂J/∂b)
w = temp_w
b = temp_b
```

**Why Simultaneous?**: Both derivatives calculated using same (old) parameter values

#### **Incorrect Implementation** (Don't do this):
```
temp_w = w - α × (∂J/∂w)
w = temp_w
temp_b = b - α × (∂J/∂b)  # Uses updated w!
b = temp_b
```

**Problem**: Second derivative uses updated w value, creating different algorithm

#### **Practical Note**: Simultaneous update is more natural to implement in code anyway.

### Gradient Descent Intuition (Single Parameter)

#### **Simplified Case**: Minimize J(w) with only parameter w
**Update Rule**: w = w - α × (dJ/dw)

#### **Visual Understanding**
**Setup**: 2D graph with w (horizontal) and J(w) (vertical)

**Case 1: Positive Derivative**
- **Situation**: Standing on upward-sloping part of curve
- **Tangent Line**: Points up and to the right
- **Derivative**: Positive number (slope > 0)
- **Update**: w = w - α × (positive number) = smaller w
- **Result**: Move left on graph (toward minimum)
- **Correct Behavior**: Cost decreases

**Case 2: Negative Derivative**  
- **Situation**: Standing on downward-sloping part of curve
- **Tangent Line**: Points down and to the right
- **Derivative**: Negative number (slope < 0)
- **Update**: w = w - α × (negative number) = w + (positive number) = larger w
- **Result**: Move right on graph (toward minimum)
- **Correct Behavior**: Cost decreases

#### **Key Insight**: Gradient descent automatically moves toward minimum regardless of which side you start from.

### Learning Rate Effects

#### **Learning Rate Too Small**
**Problem**: Takes tiny steps
**Result**: 
- Algorithm works but very slowly
- Many iterations needed
- Wastes time and computational resources

**Visual**: Many tiny steps slowly approaching minimum

#### **Learning Rate Too Large**  
**Problem**: Takes huge steps
**Consequences**:
- May overshoot minimum
- Cost can actually increase
- Algorithm may diverge (get worse instead of better)
- May never converge to solution

**Visual**: Bouncing back and forth over minimum, getting further away

#### **Already at Minimum**
**Special Case**: What happens if you start exactly at minimum?
**Derivative**: Equals zero at minimum (tangent line is horizontal)
**Update**: w = w - α × 0 = w (no change)
**Result**: Parameters stay unchanged (correct behavior)

### Automatic Step Size Adjustment

#### **Natural Property**: As you approach minimum, derivative gets smaller
**Effect**: Steps automatically become smaller near minimum
**Benefit**: 
- Algorithm naturally slows down as it approaches solution
- Helps prevent overshooting
- Works even with fixed learning rate

**Visual Demonstration**:
- **Far from minimum**: Large derivative → large steps
- **Near minimum**: Small derivative → small steps  
- **At minimum**: Zero derivative → no movement

### Convergence

#### **Definition**: Algorithm reaches point where parameters no longer change significantly
**Indication**: You've found a local minimum
**Stopping Criteria**: Various methods to detect convergence automatically

### Summary of Gradient Descent
- **Universal Algorithm**: Minimizes any cost function
- **Hill-Walking**: Intuitive analogy for understanding process
- **Key Components**: Learning rate (step size) + derivative (direction)
- **Implementation**: Must update all parameters simultaneously
- **Automatic Adjustment**: Steps get smaller as you approach minimum
- **Applications**: Foundation for most machine learning algorithms

## 9. Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

### Combining the Pieces
**Integration**: Use squared error cost function with gradient descent algorithm for linear regression.
**Result**: Complete machine learning algorithm that can fit straight lines to data.

### Derivative Calculations for Linear Regression

#### **Required Derivatives**
For J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ[f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]² where f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b:

**∂J/∂w = (1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾**

**∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]**

#### **Complete Algorithm**
**Repeat until convergence**:
- temp_w = w - α × [(1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾]
- temp_b = b - α × [(1/m) × Σ(i=1 to m) [f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]]
- w = temp_w
- b = temp_b

**Where**: f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) = wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b

### Optional Calculus Derivation

#### **For ∂J/∂w**:
Starting with: J(w,b) = (1/2m) × Σ[wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²

Using chain rule:
∂J/∂w = (1/2m) × Σ 2[wx⁽ⁱ⁾ + b - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾

Simplifying (2's cancel):
∂J/∂w = (1/m) × Σ[f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾] × x⁽ⁱ⁾

#### **For ∂J/∂b**:
Similarly: ∂J/∂b = (1/m) × Σ[f(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]

**Note**: The factor 1/2 in the cost function makes these derivatives cleaner.

### Special Property: Convex Cost Function

#### **Global Minimum Guarantee**
**Linear Regression Advantage**: Squared error cost function is **convex**
**Definition**: Bowl-shaped function with single global minimum
**No Local Minima**: Unlike general case, can't get trapped in suboptimal solutions

**Visual**: 3D bowl shape (not multiple hills and valleys)
**Mathematical Term**: Convex function

#### **Practical Implication**
**Convergence**: With appropriate learning rate, algorithm **always** converges to global minimum
**Reliability**: No need to worry about starting point
**Consistency**: Same optimal solution regardless of initialization

## 10. Running Gradient Descent

### Visual Demonstration

#### **Setup**
**Training Data**: House size and price scatter plot
**Cost Function Visualization**: 
- Contour plot (top right): Bird's eye view of cost function
- 3D surface plot (bottom): Full bowl-shaped cost function

#### **Initialization**
**Starting Parameters**: w = -0.1, b = 900 (instead of typical w=0, b=0)
**Starting Function**: f(x) = -0.1x + 900
**Starting Position**: Outer edge of cost function contour

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Iteration 1**
**Movement**: From outer contour point toward center
**Direction**: Down and to the right on contour plot
**Effect**: Straight line fit improves slightly
**Cost**: Decreases from starting value

#### **Iteration 2**  
**Movement**: Continues toward minimum
**Pattern**: Following path that reduces cost most efficiently
**Line Changes**: f(x) continues to fit data better
**Progress**: Getting closer to global minimum

#### **Subsequent Iterations**
**Trajectory**: Parameters follow curved path toward center
**Cost Reduction**: Decreases at each step
**Line Evolution**: Straight line fit gets progressively better
**Convergence**: Eventually reaches global minimum

#### **Final Result**
**Optimal Parameters**: w and b values at center of contour plot
**Best Fit Line**: Straight line that fits training data very well
**Practical Use**: Can now predict house prices for new inputs

### Making Predictions

#### **Example Prediction**
**New House**: 1,250 square feet
**Process**: Plug into final model f(x) = wx + b
**Prediction**: Read off estimated price (e.g., $250,000)
**Application**: Help clients make informed decisions

### Batch Gradient Descent

#### **Technical Definition**
**"Batch"**: Algorithm looks at **all** training examples on each iteration
**Computation**: Each derivative calculation uses entire dataset (sum from i=1 to m)
**Alternative Methods**: Other gradient descent variants use subsets of data

#### **Why "Batch"?**
**Complete Dataset**: Uses full "batch" of training examples each step
**Contrast**: Mini-batch or stochastic variants use smaller subsets
**Newsletter Connection**: DeepLearning.AI's "The Batch" newsletter named after this concept

#### **Standard Approach**: Batch gradient descent is most common for linear regression
