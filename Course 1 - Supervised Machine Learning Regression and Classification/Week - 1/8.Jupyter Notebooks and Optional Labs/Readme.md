## 🛠️ What You'll Use to Code: Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are the **industry-standard tool** for machine learning and data science development. They are:
- Interactive
- Web-based
- Widely used by professionals at companies around the world

> ✅ **You’ll use the same tool professionals use!**

## 🧪 Types of Labs in This Course

### 1. ✅ **Optional Labs** (This Week)
- **No coding required**
- Pre-written code already provided
- You just:
  - Read the Markdown text
  - Run the code cells using `Shift + Enter`
  - Optionally: tweak and play with the code
- 💯 Guaranteed full marks — **because there are no marks!**
- Great way to:
  - See how real machine learning code works
  - Build intuition for how algorithms behave

### 2. ✍️ **Practice Labs** (Starting Next Week)
- You’ll write some code yourself
- More hands-on learning
- Build confidence and understanding by doing

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook Basics

Jupyter Notebooks are made of **cells**. Two main types:

### 1. 📄 Markdown Cells:
- Contain formatted text (like explanations or instructions)
- Can be edited (feel free to customize or annotate)

### 2. 💻 Code Cells:
- Contain Python code
- Run a cell with `Shift + Enter`
- Output appears directly below

🔁 Tip: If you select a Markdown cell and press `Shift + Enter`, it will re-render the formatted text.

## 🧠 How to Approach Optional Labs

1. **Scroll and explore** the notebook layout
2. **Read Markdown cells** to understand what the code is doing
3. **Predict** what each code cell will do
4. **Run it with `Shift + Enter`**
5. (Optional) **Edit and experiment** with the code to see how it changes the output

> 🧪 You’ll get a feel for Python and how machine learning models are built step-by-step.

## 🙌 Why This Matters

Learning to use Jupyter Notebooks:
- Makes you **job-ready**
- Lets you **experiment freely** with code
- Prepares you to build real ML projects
