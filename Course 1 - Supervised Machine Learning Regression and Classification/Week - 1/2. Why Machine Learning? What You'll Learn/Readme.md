# 📘 Lecture 2: Why Machine Learning? What You'll Learn

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn in This Course

In this course, you will:

- Learn **state-of-the-art** machine learning (ML) algorithms.
- **Implement ML algorithms** from scratch and see how they perform.
- Understand **practical tips and tricks** to make ML systems work effectively in real-world scenarios.

> 🚀 These are the same algorithms and techniques used at **leading AI and tech companies** today.

## 🌍 Why is Machine Learning So Widely Used?

ML has grown out of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — a field aimed at creating **intelligent machines**.

### 🎯 Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning

- For tasks like **finding the shortest path (GPS)**, we can write explicit programs.
- But for more complex tasks like:
  - **Web search**
  - **Speech recognition**
  - **Medical diagnosis (from X-rays)**
  - **Self-driving cars**

> 🔑 We **don’t know how** to write these programs by hand.  
> 🤖 Instead, we **teach machines to learn** from data — that's **machine learning**.

## 🧪 Real-World Work in AI

Andrew Ng has worked on various AI applications across different industries:

- **Google Brain**:  
  - Speech recognition  
  - Computer vision for Google Maps (Street View)  
  - AI-powered advertising

- **Baidu**:  
  - Augmented reality  
  - Fraud detection  
  - Self-driving cars

- **Landing AI, AI Fund, Stanford University**:  
  - Factory automation  
  - Agriculture  
  - Healthcare  
  - E-commerce

> 🧑‍💻 *"Today, there are hundreds of thousands — maybe millions — of people working on ML applications who could tell similar stories."*

## 🌟 Endless Applications Across Industries

ML is becoming ubiquitous:

- 🛍️ Retail
- ✈️ Travel
- 🚗 Automotive
- 🧱 Manufacturing
- 📦 Logistics
- 🏥 Healthcare

> 💡 *There’s hardly an industry untouched — or that won’t be touched — by ML.*

## 🌐 The Future: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

### 🤖 What is AGI?

AGI = Machines as **intelligent as humans**

- This dream of AGI is **overhyped** and likely still **decades (or centuries)** away.
- Yet, many researchers believe that the path toward AGI lies in building better **learning algorithms**, potentially inspired by the **human brain**.

> You'll hear more about AGI and the broader goals of AI later in this course.

## 📈 The Economic Impact of Machine Learning

> 📊 According to **McKinsey**, AI/ML could add:
> 
> **💰 $13 Trillion USD annually by 2030**

While ML is already creating immense value in **software**, even **greater opportunities** remain in sectors **outside software**.
